# Gradient ascent with memoryless robots

This work is an improvement of the gradient climbing algorithm proposed in :

* Elor, Y., & Bruckstein, A. M. (2014). 'Robot Cloud' gradient climbing with point measurements.*
Theoretical Computer Science

It adresses the issue of detecting **multiple**  sources with a swarm of memoryless agents and unable to communicate their measurements to other agents.
